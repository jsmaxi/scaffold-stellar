# Troubleshooting

- If you need to clean the project (remove the target folder and all compiled artifacts), run: `cargo clean`.

- When you first open the project in an IDE with Rust Analyzer, it may start building dependencies in the background: `Building compile-time-deps...`. During this process, the `target` folder may be temporarily locked. If you run `just test` or other build commands before this finishes, you may see errors like: `Blocking waiting for file lock on build directory`. Solution: wait for Rust Analyzerâ€™s background build to complete before running commands.

- If you run `just test` or other commands in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), the build may consume a lot of memory. On machines with limited WSL resources, builds can terminate unexpectedly due to out-of-memory errors. Solution: increase WSL resources by editing (or creating) `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\.wslconfig` file if possible.

- For Windows users, please refer [here](./WINDOWS.md).
